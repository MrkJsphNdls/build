# My Basic Webpage

## Purpose of the Webpage

The purpose of this website is to show the elements of semantic HTML and practice my skills and knowledge in HTML.

## List of Semantic Elements Used

In my webpage, I used 7 semantic elements, which are:
- `<header>`
- `<nav>`
- `<main>`
- `<article>`
- `<section>`
- `<aside>`
- `<footer>`

## Accessibility Considerations Applied

The accessibility considerations applied in my simple webpage include:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: it declares the document type and version of HTML being used.
- `<html lang="en">`: it specifies the language of the document, which helps screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- `<title>My Basic Webpage</title>`: it provides a title for the webpage, which is important for accessibility and SEO.

You can see these elements at the beginning of my code.
